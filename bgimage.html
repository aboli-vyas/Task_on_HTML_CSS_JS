     <h2 style="color: red;">Hey, I am Butterfly!</h2>
     <p>Hello, dear human! I flutter through the world on gossamer wings, whispering secrets to the flowers and sipping sunlight from blossoms. My life is short, yet filled with beauty—each moment a dance on the breeze. You marvel at my colors, but do you see the quiet strength it took to become this? From crawling on leaves to cocooned stillness, I changed completely, and maybe that’s what I wish to tell you: transformation is not only possible—it’s natural. Embrace your seasons. Trust your wings.</p>
